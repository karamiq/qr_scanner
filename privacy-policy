# Privacy Policy

**Last update:** 2025-06-

Thank you for using our QR Scanner app.

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our App.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

We do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (PII) through our App.

The App works primarily offline and stores all data locally on your device.

## 2. Local Data Storage

Any QR codes you scan or generate using the App are stored locally on your device in a secure database. This data is only accessible by you and can be deleted at any time through the App's "Clear History" feature.

We do not access, view, or share your stored data.

## 3. Camera Access

The app requires camera permission to scan QR codes. The camera feed is not recorded, saved, or transmitted. Images are only processed temporarily to detect QR codes.

## 4. Storage Access

The App may request permission to access your device's storage. This is only used to:
- Save generated QR code images to your gallery
- Import images from your gallery for QR code scanning
- Export QR codes as images

We do not access or read any unrelated files or folders on your device.

## 5. Additional Permissions

The App may request other permissions for enhanced functionality:
- **Contacts**: Only when you choose to add contact information from QR codes
- **Calendar**: Only when you choose to add events from QR codes  
- **WiFi**: Only when connecting to WiFi networks from QR codes
- **Location**: Only when using location-based QR codes
- **Vibration**: For haptic feedback when scanning

These permissions are optional and only used when you actively choose to use these features.

## 6. Third-Party Services

**AdMob**: Our App displays advertisements through Google AdMob to support development. AdMob may collect standard advertising data (device ID, IP address) as governed by Google's Privacy Policy. You can opt out of personalized ads in your device settings.

**External Apps**: When you interact with QR codes, the App may open external applications (browsers, email apps, social media, etc.). These apps have their own privacy policies.

## 7. Children's Privacy

Our App does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13. The App is safe for all age groups as no personal data is collected.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any changes, we will update the "Last update" date at the top of the policy. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
